T.Baghfalaki and M. Ganjali (2020). Approximate Bayesian inference for joint linear and partially linear models of longitudinal zero-inflated count and time to event data, SMMR. 

BUGS codes and R codes for this paper are available in this page. 
The files include: 

1) the codes for simulating four data sets and their corresponding simulated data sets (including joint linear model for ZIP and event time, joint linear model for ZINB and event time,  joint partially linear model for ZIP and event time, joint partially linear model for ZINB and event time). 

2) R codes (R2OpenBUGS) for analysing  the data sets by using the proposed joint modeling.

3) R codes (INLA) for analysing  the data sets by using approximate Bayesian inference. 

4) The code for drawing a plot of the estimated curve by the joint partially linear model for ZI and event time.
